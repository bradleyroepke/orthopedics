Stern, MD, Cincinnati, OH  The unprotected position and long moment arm of  the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint make it vul-  nerable to injury. Some injuries are purely ligamen-  tous, while others result in an intra-articular fracture  with or without subluxation or dislocation. Unfortu-  nately, clinicians and coaches often relegate PIP in-  juries to \"nuisance status\"",

Adamantinoma (AD) is a rare, low-grade malignant primary bone tumor that occurs most often in the tibia and/or fibula of adolescent persons and young adults; however, it has been reported in other long bones, as well. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence has shown that the neoplastic cell in AD deriv",

Rotator cuff disease,  glenohumeral  instability, or glenohumeral  loss of cartilage account for  most chronic  shoulder  disabilities. For the first two  con-  ditions, treatment is directed  toward the  musculotendinous cuff and capsule; for gle-  nohumeral cartilage  loss, prosthetic surfaces  often  must be substituted to eliminate the  pain.

    "pdfTextPreview": "Arthroscopic Management of the Stiff Elbow Abstract Elbow stiffness is a challenge to manage effectively. Elbow contractures commonly result from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, causing limited motion. Recent technical advances in elbow arthroscopy have led to the development of minimally invasive procedures for the management of select cases of recalcitrant elbow stiffness. As with most arthroscopic procedures, a notable learning curve is associated with the safe, effective execution of",

To gain maximal exposure, the radial nerve must be mobilized at the spiral groove. For exposure of only the proximal humeral shaft, many surgeons prefer the anterolateral approach because",

Contemporary Indications and Techniques for Definitive Surgical Management Abstract Once the patient with pelvic fracture is resuscitated and stabilized, definitive surgical management and anatomic restoration of the pelvic ring become the goal. Understanding injury pattern by stress examination with the patient under anesthesia helps elucidate the instability. Early fixation of the unstable pelvis is important for mobilization, pain control, and prevention of chronic",

In the literature, the reported number of anatomic compartments in the foot has ranged from 3 to 10, and the clinical relevance of these compartments has recently been investigated. Diagnosis of FCS can be challenging because the signs and symptoms are less reliable indicators than tho",
